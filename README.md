## What it is

This is my final project for the Front-End degree from The Iron Yard. The app allows a master admin to create a tournament and manage the all created tournaments from a central dashboard. Additionally, visiting teams can register online and keep track of their teams standings within their group, as well as the tournament as a whole. Fans of each team can also keep track of their team's progress, scores, and game locations. Overall, 'The Standings' is my first robust web application that will be tested and used by the Clemson Club Soccer Team.


## Business Justification

When I was in grad school at Clemson University, I was the president of the Men's Club Soccer team. As such, I was in charge of organizing our bi-annual tournament. We registered teams through snail mail, kept teams updated with the standings displayed on a piece of poster board on a single field, and didn't really have a way of calculating the points, other than by hand. This gave me my inspiration for TheStandings.
